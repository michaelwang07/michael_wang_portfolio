        As a passionate and dedicated individual, I embarked on my journey in software engineering after graduating high school. Despite facing numerous challenges along the way, such as navigating the complex process of getting a degree without any mentors to guide me, I persevered. I graduated in June of 2022 with a Computer Science degree. After self studying and equipped with a strong foundation in software engineering, I am eager to contribute my skills and dedication to a rewarding career in the tech industry.
